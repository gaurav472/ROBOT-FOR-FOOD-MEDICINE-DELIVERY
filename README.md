# Running the COVID Robot Navigation Program

This guide will help you compile and run the COVID Robot navigation program using Java in the command prompt (CMD).

## Folder Structure
Ensure that your files are structured as follows:
```
Desktop/
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ covidrobot/
    â”œâ”€â”€ CovidWardRobot.java  # Main class containing the main function
    â”œâ”€â”€ Robot.java           # Robot class handling navigation logic
```

## Steps to Run the Program

### 1. Open Command Prompt
Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and hit `Enter` to open the command prompt.

### 2. Navigate to the `covidrobot` Folder
Run the following command:
```
cd Desktop\covidrobot
```
This changes the directory to the folder where your Java files are located.

### 3. Compile the Java Files
To compile  `CovidWardRobot.java`, use:
```
javac CovidWardRobot.java 
```
If there are no errors, it will generate `.class` files in the same directory.

### 4. Run the Program
After successful compilation, run the program using:
```
java CovidWardRobot
```

### 5. Provide Input
The program will prompt you to enter input. Example input:
```
5 5
1 2 N
LMLMLMLMM
```
After entering the input, press `Enter`. The program will then output the final position of the robot.

### 6. Expected Output
Example output based on the given input:
```
1 3 N
```

### Troubleshooting
- If `javac` is not recognized, ensure that Java is installed and added to the system `PATH`.
- Check that both `CovidWardRobot.java` and `Robot.java` are in the same directory before compiling.

## Java Version Requirement
Ensure that Java is installed by running:
```
java -version
```
If Java is not installed, download it from [Oracle's official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) and set up the environment variables accordingly.
